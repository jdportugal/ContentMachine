## Transcrição

Have you ever felt how an elegant
reasoning models are? Like you get LLMs
generating a bunch of tokens to think
then outputting a result and it's so
effective that basically every existing
model nowadays is doing this to get a
huge performance boost. Yet, it is such
an unsatisfying solution. But I guess
sometimes beggars can't be choosers as
test time compute is an inevitable
consequence of intelligent models
because when you let models reason in
more than one pass, you provide a space
for them to refine and iteratively
improve. And chain of thought provides a
space for transformers to externalize
their thinking in the tokens to
assimilate iterations. And so far, it
works extremely well. However, it
definitely makes you wonder why can't
reasoning in chain of thought be done in
a way that's not yapping tokens at
inference. Why can't researchers just
develop a method that can think innately
or, you know, in a more compact form?
Well, in today's video, let us take a
look at this rather new concept called
loop transformers where instead of doing
test time compute through generating
tokens, you do it through looping
transformer layers. This is one of the
methods that people are suspecting in
Claude 3 this is using behind the scenes
as it seems to have some extraordinary
reasoning capabilities that previous
models struggled with. More
specifically, the benchmark graph walk
BFS. And if you think about it,
shouldn't a recurrence design
architecturally be better than doing it
at token level as a token level has to
also decompress and compress information
into tokens to do the thinking. So,
before I dive into it, while we are on
the topic of elegance, fine-tuning AI
models on bare metal GPUs is probably
the last thing you would think of when
you have to deal with container runtimes
and systems like Kubernetes. However,
today's sponsor Crusoe has turned this
painful process into something much more
elegant. They have built something
called serverless fine-tuning to help
you customize open models like Quen,
Deep See, Gemma, and GPT-OSS faster and
more easily with token-based pricing. In
just a few lines of code, you can launch
a fine-tuning job on an Nvidia optimized
tarware. So, no GPU wrangling needed.
You just upload your dataset and the job
scales automatically. What I dig about
Crusoe is that they aren't a black box.
They are opinionated by default with
smart presets to get you started, but
open by design so you can tailor
settings to your unique use case. But
most importantly, you own your own
weights. When the job is done, you get
your raw weights back in portable
formats like dot safe tensors. So stop
wasting time and resources trying to
debug your own infrastructure and start
actually shipping your models because
you can now take a custom model from
experiment to production in a single
afternoon. Check them out now using the
link down description to get the early
access to Crusoe's serverless
fine-tuning today. And thank you Crusoe
for sponsoring this video. Anyways, to
even evaluate a tip of the reasoning
iceberg, we need to somehow first
measure reasoning capabilities to be
able to prove the effectiveness of any
model improvements, right? So at its
most basic form, reasoning can show up
as multi-hop reasoning. For instance,
who is the 44th US president's wife? For
a slightly simpler model, it cannot
directly map it to Michelle Obama
because it has to first identify the
44th US president is Barack Obama and
remember name, which is Michelle Obama.
And that is basically two hops, where
each hop is retrieving or computing a
new piece of information that depends on
the previous one. But why is this
reasoning? Well, simple single-step
question answering can usually be
achieved through pattern matching and
memorization, so it's much easier to
answer for LLMs. However, multi-hop
usually requires state tracking and
intermediate computation because the
question's answer would need to be
inferred from multiple sources of
knowledge, which is harder to memorize.
This makes it a pretty simple and
indicator for the ability to do logical
deductions, symbolic reasoning, and
relational reasoning for researchers to
use, especially as an early baseline.
But for a non-reasoning model or a
vanilla transformer, it has to do all
these in one forward pass, and if that
passes and obtained the answer, it'll
just miss the shot. And as the number of
hops increases, you're basically asking
the model to simulate a deeper and
deeper computation, but without giving
it any mechanism to actually iterate or
infer an answer. So this is one of the
reasons why chain-of-thought works. As
now, the model is no longer required to
solve the whole problem at once. It can
write an intermediate thought, read it
back, update its internal state, write
the next thought, read it back again,
and keep doing this until it reaches the
answer. So, the chain-of-thought process
within the reasoning model is basically
creating iteration through generating
extra tokens. But, this is the bit where
it starts to feel a bit inelegant
because every time the model writes a
reasoning token, that token has to be
decoded into text, appended to the
context, then re-embedded back into
hidden states onto the next pass, which
means the model has to repeatedly do
this decompress and compress cycle
through language itself just for it to
refine its latent states. On top of
that, those tokens are sampled from the
model's output distribution. So, the
model is not directly modifying the
reasoning distribution internally. It is
emitting a sampled textual trace, then
conditioning on that sampled trace
afterwards, which means the reasoning
process is mediated through discrete
token generation rather than being
performed directly in a computation
itself. So, if you were to design
recurrence architecturally, it should
logically be cleaner, right? Because you
would then be able to let the model
update its hidden state directly, and
that should be more efficient in both
time and energy because the model is
reusing internal computation and acting
on the representation directly rather
than constantly externalizing it into
tokens, which brings us to the
relatively new architecture idea that
suddenly got a lot of attention in April
2026 called a loop transformer. The core
idea is very simple. Instead of using a
long stack of unique transformer layers
once, which is the typical setup, you
only take a few layers and put them
together as a smaller block and run it
repeatedly. The output hidden state from
one recurrence becomes the input to the
same block. So, the model can refine its
representation over multiple internal
steps rather than forcing everything
into a single transformation. In the
paper loop, think, and generalize
published in April 2026, they used this
exact setup. And by iterating it, they
found that it gets better at multi-hop
reasoning, not just on the amount of
hops it was trained on, but beyond the
depth when you give it more recurrent
iterations at inference time. You can
see how these multi-hop reasoning
capabilities emerge in their three-stage
rocking process during training, too.
Looking at the training graph, at first,
you can see the model is mostly just
memorizing as the accuracy on the
training set increases and maxes out.
Then, it enters a second stage where it
starts to generalize in distribution as
the distribution test set maxes out.
This usually indicates that the model is
able to handle question compositions
that follow the same training structure,
even if the exact problem is new. After
that, the third stage emerges, and this
is a stage of systematic generalization
where the model can combine pieces of
knowledge in ways that were never
actually used compositionally during
training, meaning they can generalize
out of distribution. So, in the end, it
learned a reusable procedure for
composing and inferring answers, and
this is what vanilla transformer
struggles with as it can combine facts
in unfamiliar ways and would struggle
with extrapolation. And when you
increase the number of loops at
inference more than the amount of loops
it uses during training, it is able to
achieve even more hops than it was
trained to do. So, the number of
recurrences becomes a compute dial in
this setup, and you can literally let
the model think longer and expect better
results. But of course, once you
introduce recurrence directly into the
architecture, you also inherit a new
problem that is instability. Because
now, you are no longer applying a
sequence of different layers once, you
are applying the same transformation
the hidden state. And it also creates a
problem where you have to decide how
many times to repeat the block while
making sure the information will not go
stupid. Because once you start looping,
you are no longer just designing a
network, you are designing a thinking
process. And every recurrence is another
application of the same update rule, so
small biases get amplified, errors
accumulate, and the model can very
easily drift away from a stable
trajectory. And the model might just
refuse to converge and explode. So, this
is where the next paper, PARसी, comes
in. Instead of treating the loop as just
repeated layers, they explicitly model
it as a dynamical system over the
residual stream and analyze why naive
loop transformers become unstable. But,
why is it tied to the residual stream?
Well, because the model's hidden state
is carried forward and updated at every
recurrence rather than recomputed from
scratch. With each loop, it uses the
previous hidden state, mixes it with the
injection input, applies the transformer
operations, and produces the next hidden
state. So, the residual stream is
basically the model's evolving latent
state, the main channel where
information accumulates across
recurrences. If the dynamics are
unstable, then the hidden state norm can
grow across recurrences, which leads to
loss spikes and divergence. And all they
had to do is to constrain and normalize
the recurrence so that each update
doesn't collapse under an uncontrolled
accumulation, which solves one of the
key issues that a loop transformer has.
But, even if you can't stabilize the
loop, how do you know the model is truly
reasoning? Because better multi-hop
performance alone isn't really enough.
And we're just kind of interpreting that
it would work. So, this other paper,
also published in April 2026, called
mechanistic analysis of loop reasoning
models, comes perfectly into the
picture. Their method is to track the
latent states across recurrences and
observe how they evolve. But, because
these hidden states are extremely
high-dimensional, you cannot just
visualize them directly. So, they use
tools like PCA or principal component
analysis, which is basically a way of
compressing a high-dimensional
activation space into a few main
directions that explain most of the
variations. In simpler terms, it lets
you take the models internal states and
project them onto a 2D or 3D map so you
can actually see whether the
representations are drifting randomly,
collapsing, or following a stable
trajectory. And what they find is that
these loop models tend to move towards
stable trajectories in latent space. In
some cases, it looks like a fixed point
where the representation gradually
stabilizes. In other cases, it looks
like a cyclic trajectory where the
hidden state revisits a consistent
sequence of state across the repeated
block. The internal processes did not
change their representation
unpredictably or quickly collapse to
something trivial. But, they still push
this analysis further by looking at
attention behavior across recurrences.
And what they observe is that as the
hidden states approach these fixed
points or cycles, the attention head
behavior also stabilizes. So, it is not
just the raw activation settling down,
the actual computation being performed
by the blocks becomes more consistent,
too. What's also fascinating is that the
recurrent blocks can learn stages of
inference that mirror the stages seen in
feedforward transformers. Except, now
those stages are repeated and organized
through recurrence. So, early
recurrences, middle recurrences, and
later recurrences can play different
roles even though the weights are
shared. With early recurrences tend to
construct a rough representation of the
problem with the model gathering and
organizing the relevant information for
it, so its updates are larger and more
exploratory. But, as it moves into the
middle iterations, the model would start
to combine pieces of information and
propagate relationships. Here is also
where the updates become more structured
instead of forming them. Then, in later
iterations, the updates shrink with the
model mainly stabilizing the
representation and converging toward a
final answer. So, even though the block
is shared, the loop is not just
repeating the same computation over and
over again. And it is the input to the
block that differs every time that
forces the same function to act
differently at each step, which
naturally creates a progression from
coarse understanding to refined
solution, and that is beautiful. But,
there could be more to be optimized
because even if looping gives you
internal reasoning, you are still
applying the same number of recurrences
to every token. So, whether a token is
trivial or extremely complex, it still
has to go through the same number of
loops. And that introduces a new kind of
inefficiency because now you are
allocating compute uniformly even when
it is not needed. So, this exact
limitation is where this paper, Mixture
of Recursions, published all the way
back in July 2025, tries to solve.
Instead of forcing every token through
the same number of loops, it introduces
a router that decides how many
recurrences each token actually needs.
And in the paper, there are two main
ways this is implemented into MOR. In
one version, the router assigns each
token to a recursion depth bucket. So,
before looping even starts, it predicts
how many steps that token should go
through. This is pretty efficient
because the computation path is fixed
from the start, but it relies heavily on
that initial prediction being correct.
Like, if the model misjudges the
difficulty early on, it cannot adjust
later. In the other version, the
decision is made step-by-step, where at
each iteration, the model can choose to
continue or exit. This is much more
flexible and can adapt as the
representation evolves, which usually
leads to better allocation of compute.
However, it is slightly more complex and
can be harder to train and stabilize
since decisions are made repeatedly
during the process rather than once at
the beginning. But, the step-by-step
version, which they call expert choice
routing, ends up working noticeably
better than the upfront assignment
version, which they call token choice
routing. And under the same three
recursion setup, expert choice routing
reaches an average few-shot accuracy of
42.6% while token choice routing drops
to 40%. So, even though token choice
sounds cleaner on paper because each
token commits to its full compute path
from the beginning, in practice, it
actually is not that useful. Which just
shows deciding how much thinking a token
needs before the iterative process even
starts is just too hard. But yeah, these
are where the extra efficiency gains can
come from. However, once you make
recursion adaptive, another bottleneck
immediately shows up, which is the KV
cache. In a standard transformer, every
layer stores key and value tensors for
every token, and this quickly dominates
memory and bandwidth, especially during
long context decoding. Recursive models
make this even worse in a naive setup
because even though parameters are
shared, you still maintain separate KV
caches for each recursion depth. So, you
are not actually saving much on memory
traffic. But, MOR addresses this by
changing how KV caching works to match
the adaptive recursion. Their first
strategy is recursion-wise caching,
where KV pairs are only stored for
tokens that are still active at a given
recursion step. Since tokens can exit
early, deeper recursions operate on
fewer tokens, which means both memory
usage and attention computation shrink
as depth increases. This makes the model
more efficient not just in terms of
parameters, but also in actual runtime
behavior because it avoids wasting
memory bandwidth on tokens that no
longer need further processing. The
second strategy is recursive KV sharing.
So, instead of storing KV pairs at every
recursion, the model caches them once at
the first recursion and reuses them for
all subsequent steps. This dramatically
reduces memory footprint since you are
no longer duplicating KV states across
depths. However, this comes with a
trade-off because later recursions are
now attending to slightly stale
representations, which can hurt
performance compared to recursion-wise
caching. So, recursion-wise caching is
more accurate because it keeps
representations fresh at every step, but
it uses way more memory. On the other
hand, recursive sharing is more memory
efficient, but slightly degrades
quality. Is that a problem then? Well,
the paper shows that these trade-offs
are manageable and both approaches still
outperform standard recursive and
vanilla transformers when combined with
adaptive routing. And you know what time
it is? It's time to address the elephant
in the room. So, after all these
wonderful cool new techniques were
published with very good solutions to
address their shortcomings being
proposed, how exactly competitive is the
Loop Transformer compared to the current
LM landscape then? Well, a major
argument against a Loop Transformer is
still actually its expressiveness. A
deeper or wider model with unique layers
has strictly more expressive capacity
than a shared block being reused. So,
from a pure optimization perspective,
looping is a constrained version of the
same problem. So, if you're not memory
constrained, then simply adding more
parameters in a standard transformer
easily wins. And you would easily avoid
the complicated KV cash problem compared
to the standard chain of thought method
for reasoning. So, empirically, it is
not surprising that unconstrained
transformers tend to achieve lower loss
when you scale parameters freely. On top
of that, scaling laws have historically
favored increasing parameter count
rather than reusing computation. The
second issue is about the depth itself.
Even though loop transformers can
simulate deeper computation by
increasing recurrences, this is not
identical to having genuinely deeper
architectures. A stack of unique layers
can learn different transformations at
each depth, while a looped model has to
reuse the same function repeatedly and
hope that the evolving hidden state is
enough to induce different behaviors.
The mechanistic analysis paper suggests
that this can emerge in practice, but it
is still a weaker inductive bias than
explicitly giving the model distinct
layers. So one could argue that if depth
is the bottleneck, then scaling depth
directly might still be more effective
than simulating it through recurrence,
assuming compute and memory allow it.
And then there is the question of
whether loop transformers are
fundamentally better at reasoning, but
for that, we just don't have enough
evidence yet. The results from multi-hop
benchmarks and depth extrapolation are
interesting, but they are still under
relatively controlled settings. So it is
not yet clear whether these gains fully
translate to large-scale real-world
tasks, where standard transformers
already benefit from massive
pre-training and emergent behaviors. On
top of that, a chain of thought has a
very unfair advantage, that is it's
explicit. The model reasons by writing
out in tokens, which means it can be
supervised on those traces, distilled
from them, filtered by them, reinforced
on them, and trained to imitate them
directly. So even if the reasoning is
inefficient at inference, at least the
training signal is very clear, because
the model is being shown exactly what
intermediate steps are supposed to look
like, and we can even supervise it. But
hidden state recursion does not get that
luxury. In a loop transformer, the
intermediate computation is implicit
inside hidden states. There is no
natural textual trace telling the model
what step 1 2 3 should be. The model has
to discover that structure on its own
purely through the end objective. So,
the recurrence may be architecturally
cleaner, but it is also harder to
supervise as we cannot help to guide it.
The only potential benefit I see looping
is appealing is that it lets you trade
compute for effective depth without
increasing parameter count. This could
be useful for scenarios like synthetic
data generation, distillation, or edge
deployment like on mobile devices where
you cannot afford a massive model, but
still want iterative refinement and
basically in a regime where chain of
thought is not as efficient or as smart,
then loop transformers can potentially
outperform their parameter class because
they can reuse computation efficiently.
But, at a large-scale inference where
latency and throughput matter more than
parameter count, repeatedly applying the
same block can actually hurt performance
compared to a well-optimized feedforward
stack. So, maybe for tiny models in the
future, loop transformers might be
applied there. But, what do you think?
