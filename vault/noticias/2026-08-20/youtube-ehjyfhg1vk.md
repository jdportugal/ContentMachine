## Descrição

He has not written a line of code this year, and has not read most of it either, yet he ships a full email client that thousands of people trust with their inbox. Kieran Klaassen has been rebuilding Cora alone since January, and the useful part of his account is the sequence of bottlenecks he moved through. Two years ago the code itself was bad, so he layered on review and skills until it got good. Then the plans were the constraint, until those got good too. Then knowing what to build at all. What was left after that was him repeating himself, which is what a memory system exists to fix.

That is where compound engineering came from, and the rule attached to it is the demanding one. Spend half your time building the feature and the other half teaching the system whatever it got wrong. His counterintuitive claim is that this ends up cheaper in tokens rather than more expensive, because a stored solution means no correction pass and no research detour the next time around. The loop puts the human at both ends, brain on to decide what the problem actually is, then brain on again at the finish to raise the bar rather than to run QA, with hours of autonomous work in between. The bar he holds it to is that the next feature should be easier to build because this one shipped, which inverts the way complexity normally accumulates.

>> Hello, hello everyone.
Welcome.
I want to start with saying I haven't
written
a single line of code this year and
maybe I haven't even looked at most of
it.
Yet, I do ship.
I have
product I built that thousands of people
use and trust with their email inbox,
which is amazing.
I'm actually proud of the code I ship
and
I'm proud of the product I ship.
I've been doing this for 2 years and
trying to extract my thinking and my
taste into a system that compounds and
I'm going to share you how I do that.
Lots of stuff you hear is like oh, you
should use this, the factory, dark
factory, do this, blah blah blah, all
the new high hip cool things. What I'm
trying to do is not that today. I'm
going to just show you how I work
and hopefully share something that you
can bring to your workflow that will
outlive trends and really set yourself
up for success for newer models, bigger
models.
There are two halves in this talk. One
is why it's so important to compound,
how I got here. So, this is for people
that maybe are not at the end of the
trajectory. It's interesting to see how
to get there. And then stuff you can run
yourself, you can use
day-to-day to ship, to build, to
research, to do knowledge work even.
Hello, I'm Kieran. I work Every. Every
is an AI lab for the future of work and
we ask ourselves the question
what's next? And we write about it. We
teach about it. We build and we have a
studio
where we have mostly single engineering
teams that
take a problem they really care about
and use AI to
build a product out and really leverage
that and compounded knowledge is a big
way we do that. Lots of loops, shipping
faster and faster and Cora's mine is
where I invented compound engineering
and it's a complete AI email inbox. It's
agent native so that means whatever you
can do the agent can do. It runs on your
desktop phone, CLI, inside Codex like
uh
MCPs and I'm rebuilding it as version
two. So, soon beta access. If you want
access, just DM me, talk to me.
The cool part is
it's one engineer and I have support. I
have design support. I have some like
database
hardcore engineering problem support
like you need some support um
but I
built a full email client alone and I've
only started building this in January
this new rebuild. I use Rails on the
back end. I love Ruby. React on the
front end and I own products
fully. So, I
talk to people. When something goes
down, I'm the one responsible.
And it's set up like this on purpose.
I'm a ex Vbev engineer and founder. I
know how to hire, grow teams, all that
stuff, but I wanted to do the opposite
with Sonar 3.5.
I just felt there was something new that
was unlocked and I wanted to see how far
can AI go before I actually need to grow
the team. And I'm still alone with some
support, which is cool.
So, I built Cora, and this is what I
learned.
2 years ago I started, and the
bottleneck by then was code. So, it kept
moving, and my job changed over the
years, but first there was bad code,
hallucination, just stuff that didn't
work. I added
agents, I added skills, just reviewing
it. So, okay. Code got good. The plan
was the bottleneck because
I could do things,
but larger things. So, whenever I have a
good plan set out, it would do bigger
things than just code changes.
Okay, plans got good. Um the next
bottleneck was deciding what to build.
Talking with users, really understanding
problems you're solving. This is why
it's so good that you use your own
products. You love what you're building
for.
And
that got really good as well. The scope
got bigger. AI could help writing uh
plans, and I kept repeating myself, and
that was annoying. So, I figured out
there needs to be some kind of memory
system. So, every time um I repeat
myself, I can say, "Hey, can you make
sure to store this knowledge in some
way?" I started with storing this in
Claude MD, but at some point it became
too large. Um so, I built a system that
remembers, and that's really where
compound engineering came from.
And you see me go away from typing more
towards judgment and taste. And I think
implementation is mostly solved, even
though you see many people that do
orchestration, dark factories. Woo.
It kind of works, which is cool. But the
thing that doesn't work is
our judgments and our taste. And
for me, it's really where do I turn my
brain on versus when do I leverage the
model?
And
it's where you make judgments and it's
where you add taste. So, where you
think, where you iterate, where you jam,
where you brainstorm,
I extract that into a system, and if
it's extracted into the system, you can
move on to bigger problems. Because the
next time the AI will come up with a
brainstorm, it will already include that
thinking. So, you can go on for the next
one.
And I see that one engineer with a
compounding system just beats teams,
like full teams that use AI that don't.
This is my loop.
It's
it there's more to it than this, but
this is the overview. Brainstorming,
planning, working, reviewing, polishing,
compounding, and repeating. And the real
trick here is on both ends. It's kind of
the human AI sandwich, where the human
is the bread and the AI is the middle
part. And the brain is on on the ends.
So, the start, brainstorming, where you
have to decide what to work on, what the
problem is, and really understand what
you're trying to do. And at the end,
where your taste comes in, where you
decide
this looks very good, makes me very
happy, or we need to raise the bar, we
need to do better, we need to make it
more snappy, we need to go optimistic,
or whatever that is. Like
like delight.
And throughout here, especially in the
brain on parts, it's important to
extract the learnings to compound. So,
that's basically the loop.
You cannot run the middle if it's not
set up correctly. And it's very
important to be able to let go and let
the machine rip overnight
for many hours in parallel.
And the only way to be able to do that
is making sure you spend time on
uh on that system. So, my rules 50%
should go into creating
uh the feature. Just making sure like
did it build the feature? Did it deliver
the value you set out to do? But 50% of
the time should go to
um teaching the system for anything that
it did wrong. Can we learn something?
Can you teach the system something? And
this is something that is kind of hard,
but it's very important because it will
make the next time better.
One bonus is because all of this
extraction
um I store all of this knowledge inside
my repository as uh solution documents.
And people say, "Oh, but tokens." And in
my research is actually more token
efficient because if you have the right
answers and the right solutions already
within the token, you don't need to do
review. You don't need to correct. You
don't need to do deep research across
the internet because the tokens are
already there. So, it's actually more
token efficient in the long term, which
is cool. Less research, finding things
faster.
The real reason why this works is my
brain is fixed and AI isn't or
less fixed. And my philosophy is keep
extracting until the complete middle
runs itself and is so freaking good that
it will surprise you.
Um let me show you how this works. Uh
so,
I have a plugin called the compound
engineering plugin that you can install
in whatever tool you use, Codex, Cloud,
Code, Cursor, plus 10 others.
And I just built this while building
Cora, I shared it at this some point,
and now
hundreds of thousands of people use it
daily. So, thank you all for using it if
you did. I'm honored. Um I never decided
this should be something like hype. It's
just me using my plugin shipping code.
Uh you can install it wherever. Uh you
can also create your own version of
this, which could be just storing
information in files. Uh however you do
it. But, let me show you the plugin. So,
Compound Engineering became
Compound Product as well. Uh
I have a lovely uh
co-contributor, Trevin Chow, who has a
very good product sense and product
background. So, he brought a lot of
product thinking. And I think Compound
Engineering is really for engineers,
PMs, designers, even people that do
knowledge work within every love to use
Compound Engineering. It's such a
uh like universal uh
concept of compounding knowledge. It
doesn't have to be used for engineers,
but that's where it came from uh me. So,
the first demo is
um
it's it's here to activate your brain.
So, this is called CE IDEATE, and you
can run it. And here I run it in It's
maybe a little bit small, but I say,
"Hey, I have Cora version
version one. I want to upgrade people to
version two.
Um
come up with uh Oh, no, actually, this
is Look at all my open open tickets.
Tell me what to do next." It's a great
command. It will just go through all
your issues,
and you can link linear open like open
source issues on GitHub, Slack,
Intercom. What it will do is it will
generate uh structure from all this
mess, and will make arguments about what
is good to work on versus not good to
work on.
And the cool part is it will reason
about this. And And output here is a
clean HTML page that you can share with
the team that you can be inspired by.
So, this is generation of ideas. And the
cool part is you can point it to your
OKRs. You can
get ideation aligned to your strategy.
And that's kind of how it compounds. So,
if you have past experiments or past
learnings in your repository or a
strategy document which you can create
with CE strategy, it will score these
ideas against this knowledge which is
really cool. And I've seen people dump
this document inside Claude design and
say create a PowerPoint. And you get a
beautifully designed PowerPoint with
like XY matrix of where the sweet spot
is for what to do for your OKRs which is
very low effort for you and very
impressive to bring to your team.
Uh next one is a very simple one. It's
called CE doc review, but it's very
useful. If someone hands you a PRD or
some kind of document, run doc review on
it and it comes back with very sharp
questions. I always like the questions
and like, "Oh, that's a good question. I
did not think about it." So, either you
relate this to your colleague or you
ask them to answer. You can then
compound that knowledge after answering
with CE compound so that the next time
um
this answer is already baked in and it
wouldn't ask you. It would already know
the answer because it's already embedded
in the system. You can share this with
people. You can say, "Oh, you can
actually run this yourself as well."
This runs anywhere so you can do it in
co-work as well. It doesn't need to be
in Claude code. Um it's a very simple
thing that we spend a lot of effort in
to make very good and it's part of our
flow.
This my most used one. Um it's when the
idea is too big to describe. So, this
was the example of Cora version one to
version two. I say, "C brainstorm." This
is a brain on command. Uh I know I need
to get into into the zone. I block off
time. I'm not going to multitask or
anything like that.
Um and I run this. So, it pulls in
compound knowledge. It looks at the
difference between Cora one and two, and
uh looks at the personas I have set up.
So, it will see, "Hey, like certain
people need certain things."
And it will ask me questions. And it
doesn't ask me a lot of questions. It's
dialed in to ask you just the right
amount of questions it needs to do the
work. It's very easy to get 30 questions
and feel, "Wow, I did so much." But in
the end, the goal is not to answer
questions. In the end, it's to get the
absolute best work out of it. And I
think other libraries might over
question. Uh I think there is a balance
uh to be found there. So, outcomes a
plan, a brainstorm document stored and
compounded. And then my favorite is just
{slash} LFG, which is basically the
loop, the the automation loop. And if
you like vibe coding, {slash} LFG
something is great, as well.
It will run for hours. It will do
planning work, review, testing, opens a
PR. It will dog food. It will try fix
fix things. It will then do a before and
after video screenshot in the pull
request. Makes it super easy for you to
then see what happened.
Last, if it comes back. So, this is
overnight. You can do parallel. There's
polish. This is the brain on again. See
polish, you give it the pull request.
And what it will do is it will show you
so I like to run it in cursor. And on
the left side, I like to run this, and
it will tell me, "Hey, this was
introduced with this LFG flow." And on
the right it will show the product. This
is important. Sometimes I don't even
know what was built because I also have
video recordings that I dump into LFG
that it will then process and analyze
and see what went wrong. So, sometimes I
don't even know what it was solving for.
So, it's a good primer to know, "Okay,
this is what we are where we are. This
is what it's solving. This is how I
solved it, and you tell me. What do you
think?"
And this is not QA. This is raising the
bar. Like, it should work. If it doesn't
work here, your LFG flow failed. Um but
you can see here, like this works. Only
in this example, there is a mark of uh a
logo mark twice, which is not
technically wrong, but I don't want two
marks on one page. So, in this case, I
can say, "Hey, there are marks two marks
here. Can we just make sure we only ever
have one?"
And run C compound, so it will extract
that knowledge, make sure next time when
I do design work, it's tagged correctly.
It will find that file and uh know not
to do that.
So,
that's closing the loop. You merge it,
and you learn something.
So, why does compound engineering
resonate with people? I think it's not a
very new concept. It's just something
how we do software engineering. It's
just now instead of working with teams,
we use with AI we use AI, and we
leverage that and AI is very good at
specific things, especially with large
amounts of knowledge and doing the right
thing, especially with latest models.
So, uh if you want to do this yourself,
if you don't want to use my plugin, uh
make sure to extract. Never repeat. If
you see yourself repeating yourself,
make sure to extract that somehow, make
sure it doesn't happen again.
Make sure that there is a middle that
can run without you, that does the
planning, working, reviewing, and it
should be boring. It should just work.
You should not be needed. If you're
still needed in the loop, spend time on
the middle, do it manually, feel where
it's off and like iterate until you can
actually let it go. And if if you are at
a point where you just run something and
runs for 3 hours and it's always good,
you know you're there.
>> [sighs]
>> It's important to document the thinking,
not the code. This is also very anti
developery. It's like, "Yeah, but
documentation should mean the code and
like the code is the artifact itself."
But I am of the opinion to generalize,
you need reasoning behind why you did
something. And all these traces, even
though they're bad,
could lead to things like, "Hey,
something happened. Write a postmortem.
What decision was made by whom or what
agent that led to this? Can we then turn
that into a learning so we change that
behavior for the next time?" And I've
seen it work very well,
especially with postmortems.
And again, every interaction spend 50%
of your time to make it better the next
time. So make sure to build the system
that will remember instead of was this
good, make the system better and make
the system know. And I know it's hard,
like it's just hard to do for myself.
And we all know we need to do it, but
it's kind of awkward and it's like, "Eh,
it's it works. It's great. Let's just
move on." But it's very important and
you can see the system really go if you
do that a lot.
So the bet is implementation is only
getting cheaper and judgment is not. And
the future models and systems need to be
set up so they have access to this
judgment that we have, our taste, to
have more leverage. So that is the
bottleneck. And remember brain at the
ends, really activate your brain, make
sure you really understand what you're
doing in the start. Don't offload the
thinking to the AI. Make sure you truly
feel understand what you're doing, the
problem.
Uh let the AI go and at the end raise
the bar. Make sure you don't fix things.
It should be very good at the end, but
make sure to raise the bar because we're
not shipping shitty code.
And your standard should be the next
feature should be easier because you
shipped this one. If the next feature is
harder because you added complexity,
which is normally how engineer works,
we're flipping that. The next feature
should be easier to build because you
shipped this one.
I'm Kieran. Uh check out the plugin.
It's open source. Please um
contribute. PRs welcome. I love PRs from
everyone. Go build your orchestration
system. Go build your personal uh
knowledge base that compounds. And thank
you. I will be hanging around if you
have questions and enjoy the rest of
your day.
