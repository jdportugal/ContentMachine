## Descrição

When coding agents got good enough at the end of 2025, Morgan Stanley's roughly thirty person research group asked what would happen if agents ran the research, not just wrote the code. The result is AlphaLab, a multi agent system they built and open sourced. You hand it a problem in plain language and it writes the code, sets up back tests and evals, configures and submits cluster jobs, and runs the statistical tests, managing its own context as it goes. They skipped every off the shelf framework and wrote their own harness so they could watch how it reasons and bake in their own standards.

The shape is a strategist that proposes experiments and workers that run them, laid out as a board of cards people can read, edit, and approve before the loop optimizes against a weak eval. Rappazzo shows it finding real gains now used internally, from fine tuning a model to predicting credit bonds, and argues the lasting human job is designing the verifiable environment the agents compete in, like a private Kaggle, while they handle the middle.

>> Well, thank you everyone for coming.
Um
today I'll be presenting what we've been
building at Morgan Stanley, uh sort of
auto research agent to try and automate
quant research.
Um and I wanted to just take the the
first couple minutes to sort of explain,
you know, give some context on our team
and also um you know, why we're even
pursuing trying to build this this auto
research agent. And so, our group are
relatively small. We're about 30 uh PhD
AI researchers, and we kind of
operate both like kind of half academic,
so we're encouraged to um you know,
publish papers, open-source code, share
our research. And then the other half is
sort of more applied internal work.
And you know, I think a lot of our
problems or or yeah, at least some of
them are are can be fairly well-posed.
They kind of have a similar shape to
Kaggle where we have you know, an input
time series data set, and our task is to
just, you know, predict future values
and maybe with some other constraints of
wanting the model to be well-calibrated.
Um and so, I think, you know, being on
the sell side, we kind of have maybe
less sort of adversarial selection, and
so it it kind of lends itself naturally
to this auto research framework.
Um
and you know, also I think there's we
have a lot of sort of algorithms in
production where we have a feeling if we
could just put in more cycles, there
might be some improvements to kind of
squeeze out, whether it's
just better hyperparameter tuning or
exploring a lot of different kind of
ensembling these different methods
together.
Also, you know, we have We work with a
lot of different desks, and there's a
feeling that like
something we have built for say credit
bonds could really transfer well to like
muni bonds, and that kind of translation
process should be something that can be
automatable with with agents.
And even like going to new trading desks
and trying to build them new algorithms,
there's sort of a lot of low-hanging
fruit where uh they're not really using
a lot of machine learning or or AI
automation. And so,
you know, even like a reasonably trained
model should be able to have a big
impact. And so, sort of in the last year
and a half where these these agents
became, you know, able to do
long-horizon tasks, we've been
interested in trying to do this
automation. Um but it wasn't really
until December of 2025, and I think this
is a pretty common sentiment now that
um it really felt possible for the first
time with like with Opus 4.5 and with,
you know, these harnesses like Claude
Code and Codex, where it really felt
like
the models were at a point where they
could do these long-horizon tasks and
also kind of the idea of
putting them in these harnesses that
that allow them to do so.
And so,
you know, really starting this year, we
kind of made it a big effort to build
this this auto research agent. And of
course, sort of the the top-line goal is
just maximizing P&L and maximizing the
the number of new algorithms we can put
in production.
Um
but, you know, we also had these design
concerns. Like, of course, we wanted to
play nicely and integrate with
all of our data and sort of the
pre-built scaffolding we have around
backtesting and evals.
We also wanted it to be able to run the
full spectrum. So, like,
you know, on one side, maybe it's a new
data set, and we just want to say like,
here's the path to the data, a natural
language description of what we hope to
predict, and the thing should go off and
do research and build its own eval and
start doing experimentation.
And then sort of on the other side of
the spectrum, maybe it's like,
no, we have our data scripts, we have
our eval, we actually have have good
models we've already produced, and we
just wanted to kind of churn and do more
cycles and see if we can find an
improvement.
Um also, we wanted to build this to be
really model agnostic, so we could use
any of the frontier providers or
increasingly, uh you know, any
open-source model.
And also, we wanted to build it in a way
that you know, as these models get
better and better, it's not sort of
consuming what we built. Like, we kind
of rise with the tide of the models.
And lastly, you know, really carefully
think about um how do we encode sort of
like our enterprise knowledge as Morgan
Stanley and then our human expertise as
as quant researchers.
And so, for for the rest of the talk, I
want to start with sort of what I'm
calling Alpha Lab 1.0, which is our
first version we released. I think it
was early April, and we put out a full
like 40-page tech report going through
all the details and results. We also
open-sourced all the code on GitHub. So,
I I kind of want to cover that more at a
high level because all the details are
so public, but I'm happy to talk
afterwards in depth about any part.
Um
but then I really want to cover, you
know, sort of what's happened since
then. So, what were the initial results?
What were the kind of failure cases
since then because we we have
encountered a lot of failures, and then
talk about how we're really addressing
those by building
uh kind of our own rich set of evals and
environments, and how [snorts] that's
sort of allowing us to
improve the harness and climb towards
this sort of self-recursive improvement
and sort of our grand vision now for
Alpha Lab 2.0.
And so, to start, you know, Alpha Lab is
an agentic harness, and kind of going
towards that that first side of the
spectrum, the the goal is
you have some data set, you know, let's
say it's like a uh exchange rate data
set or something, and you can just
provide the path to the file or maybe it
lives on an API and you can just say
here's the API access
and the API spec. And then just in
natural language say what you want to
predict. So maybe it's as simple as, you
know, the simple exchange rate. I would
just I'm curious in predicting one day
out what the the rate will be.
And the harness then works in these
these three phases. So the first phase
is research and I'll cover these all
more in depth. The second phase is then
actually building its own evaluation or
backtesting and the third phase is sort
of the mass experimentation, which is
really the heart of the the harness.
And then as output you get a suite of
trained machine learning models that are
trying to, you know, do the the
prediction you care about.
And
one design choice we made, so the
harness is actually all our own code. So
we decided not to use any off-the-shelf
agent framework.
Um
we wrote it all and really Claude wrote
it all and I think like in the era of of
Claude code, I I like this approach of
kind of building your own from scratch
because you get sort of
max freedom and max like,
you know, you're you're free to kind of
tweak anything you care about. Um and
so, you know, all the tool calls are
done with these like functional tool
calling and that also allows us to
nicely really be provider agnostic. So
OpenAI Anthropic or open source
providers, it's very easy to to adapt
the the harness to any any of those.
As far as the actual tools, there's
there's several but the sort of three
main ones are one full shell access, so
it can write any
bash command. So this is how it's
writing code, setting up its Python
environment, editing code, running code.
Um another important one is web search
and this allows it to go read, you know,
archive or technical blogs or anything
like that and get sort of up to speed at
um
you know, at least in the public domain
like sort of what's the state of the art
methods.
And then the third one is
um
we use Slurm to manage our GPU cluster,
but the the higher level idea is just a
a nice abstraction where the model can
say like I'm training a
a fairly big model. I need 4 H100s and
this many CPUs and just kind of write
the config config and submit the job and
not have to worry about like doing
hardware orchestration.
Uh yeah, and so going to the
the actual phases. So again, the first
phase is this this research phase. And
the idea here is kind of like almost
like a super cloud MD file or a super
init where we just want the system to go
off and kind of build enough context
such that it can start meaningfully
uh you know, forming hypotheses and
testing them.
Um
and we built, you know, Alpha Lab is
kind of this server-side running thing,
but we built this lightweight UI on top.
And so
sort of how we've done this is build
this this scaffolding of the to-do list.
So it's first, you know, prompted to to
build a to-do list such that if it
completed every item, it'd be able to
start experimenting. And this allows us
to kind of keep re-prompting should it
try to exit early. And so you can see,
you know, it's talking about setting up
its Python environment,
um doing different data loading, doing
different kinds of statistical testing.
And each item of the list it's
instructed to build a like take notes in
a markdown file. And this also allows
feature agents to smartly query that and
kind of manage their context
dynamically.
And and this is really where web search
is used most because it will go off and
read archive and and get kind of good
context from the public domain as well.
And so this can vary a lot, but um
it takes, you know, roughly around 3 to
4 hours.
The second phase and what um
is most different in 2.0 is the eval
building, but just to say sort of our
first implementation, you know, of
course the evaluation is the most
important piece and LLMs aren't
malicious, but they can make, you know,
very silly mistakes and if you're
optimizing against a bad a bad eval, the
whole thing kind of falls apart. So our
attempt to
be more robust is have this sort of
multi-agent framework. So one is tasked
with first building the eval, like
actually writing all of the code, and
then that goes off to two critic agents.
One that's told to be more high-level,
like are there conceptual errors in our
evaluation or any kind of forward
leakage of information, and then one
that's more programmatic. So it's like
writing unit tests and integration
tests.
Um and they write up any issues they
find of our issues, it goes back to the
builder to fix, and this loop doesn't
end until sort of all of them are happy
that the eval is good.
And then the third phase and really the
heart of everything is this mass
experimentation.
And so we've we've chosen, you know,
both in the code and in our UI, this is
kind of
formulated as a Jira board or Kanban
board. And so there's
this sort of strategist agent that gets
to look and query all the context from
the previous steps, and it's just
supposed to keep coming up with
experiments it wants to try, and it
submits them to this like to implement
column.
And then as new cards come in, those get
pawned off to worker agents that are
tasked with actually writing the code to
implement the strategy,
writing the Slurm config, you know, what
hardware does it need, submitting it to
our cluster,
waiting for the job to finish, and then
look at, you know, the the machine learn
learning training curves, like did it
underfit, overfit, and then also looking
at the eval results. And then it sort of
writes this postmortem analysis, which
goes back to the strategist as each job
finishes. So, the strategist hopefully
can do this kind of self-evolution. So,
it can see like I suggested, you know,
three variants of transformers that
actually didn't work too well, but uh
XGBoost is is working really well. So, I
want to explore more tree methods or
something like that.
Um
And also in this step is where we as
users can steer. So, you can, you know,
another reason we pick sort of this Jira
formation is
uh you can cancel cards, you can add
your own cards. There's also a chat
feature that's sort of cut off here, but
you can chat with the strategist and
kind of steer it towards more creative
or kind of give it intuition of
different methods that should try.
Um and then we keep this, you know,
ever-growing leaderboard where you can
see like given your eval and given a
held-out private validation set, like
what are the best-performing models? And
you can click in and see like, you know,
from inception of the idea to the code,
and you can pull it out and play with
it.
And then this is just sort of our UI
2.0, which is really just optimized to
look cool, but you can see like, you
know, it's suggesting experiments, and
this is really sped up, but how each
worker kind of pulls it through,
um you know, building, deploying, and
then analyzing the results.
And um
you know, in our paper, we did more sort
of academic data sets. So, we looked at
CUDA kernels, we looked at uh an
academic traffic time series data set,
and we did the kind of classic like
Karpathy-style LM speed running. Um and
it's sort of hard to benchmark AlphaLab,
but we compared to more of a
Karpathy-style like single agent in a
loop going, and it did find a better uh
training config for
training an LLM.
We also put this on a Kaggle
competition, which was to It was, uh,
hosted by Nvidia to fine-tune their NeMo
Tron model to be a reasoning model. Uh,
and it got in the top 12% of
submissions.
Which I think is decent, and also it
only had sort of 10 iterations to work
with because we joined late, and I
think, you know, AlphaLab works best the
more iterations it can explore. So,
presumably or hopefully it would have
done better had it, uh, had more time.
And then I can say at a high level
internally,
there's been a handful of of models, all
sort of of the flavor where we had a
decent model already, but we just turn
it over to AlphaLab to keep kind of
churning on it. Uh, where it's found
meaningful improvements that are now
working their way through risk and going
into production.
And so with the my last couple minutes,
I I want to talk about, um,
you know, we we ran into some real
issues and hard questions. Uh, I think
the first was, you know, okay, so we had
some some good results, but we've also
had cases where it's really failed. And
so it's kind of always in our head,
like, how real is is any of this, you
know, if it if it's failing on these
hardest problems, how do we measure,
how, you know, how real this is.
And the second was, and I'm sure a lot
of you might be thinking, like, okay,
your research phase sounds reasonable,
having a strategist and workers sounds
reasonable,
but isn't it sort of arbitrary, you
know, like, how do you motivate these
design choices? And how we feel now is
like, and I think a big theme of this
conference is,
you know, should we be making these
decisions at all? Like, this itself is a
verifiable loop. Like, an LLM should be
doing this this meta-optimization
itself.
And then lastly,
you know, in this this 1.0 formulation,
it's sort of like
we give the data, we give the goal, and
the LLM just goes off and does it. So,
like how does that exactly encode our,
you know, Morgan Stanley's enterprise
knowledge, but just our expertise as as
quants? Like it's sort of missing from
the picture.
And so, the answer to all three we feel
is really in building our own evals and
environments.
And so, to just sort of go one by one
through the questions,
you know, to the first point, and this
is a lesson I learned over and over,
like monthly, working with these models,
you have to start with good eval. Like
it's such an obvious thing I think we
were kind of overeager and wanted to
treat it more like a a human researcher,
but you of course need like a very clear
way to measure. And so, the the biggest
kind of change is now we're we're very
opinionated about the eval. It's very
much like Kaggle. And so, you know, we
treat it as data and description in, the
harness lives in the middle, and its
only job is to submit containerized
models. And it gets sort of the the
feedback of like a public leaderboard
score, but you as a user get to see a
private leaderboard, like held-out
validation, how's the model performing.
And so, you know, in this case,
you can measure like just for any given
task, how well does your model do?
But of course, once you have this strict
kind of format, you can think, okay,
you know, to me evals and environments
are the same thing. It's just you train
in environments.
So, now what we've done is built on the
order of like 10 to 20 really careful
environments, and that becomes a
reinforcement learning signal. And so,
we're
you know, quote-unquote AlphaLab meaning
AlphaLab. So,
once you have that way to measure, you
know, you can do human tuning of the the
harness. So, like maybe there should be
two strategists, and maybe they should
debate, or maybe there, you know,
whatever kind of ideas you have, you at
least have a way to measure and kind of
manually hill climb. But what we're
doing now is really this meta harness
optimization, where
the LLM is looking at the trace, is
looking at the about, you know, the
results, and improving the harness
itself.
And also sort of a a tangential axis is
we're now collecting good traces from
open source model and really touching
weights and doing like GRPL or or other,
you know, on policy distillation
methods. And so, we see like the the
best performing thing might be an
orchestration of open source and close
source models, but we're kind of
optimizing the whole thing together.
And to the last point, you know, how do
we as as experts encode
our expertise, we again think it's
through environments. Like building
environments, at least good
environments, is really really hard
work. You know, it's you have to be
there's of course like the data that
goes in that's proprietary, but you
know, designing the the verifiable
metrics is maybe the easy part, but then
we're also doing this qualitative
rubrics, where we kind of
look at the traces and say, you know,
what makes a good researcher, what's the
thought process, and we can grade each
roll out on, you know, how well it's
following our research process. And so,
having these good rubrics that become
the signal for the model to learn, we
feel is really how we're we're building
our own expertise into the system.
And so, just to kind of conclude the the
2.0 version is really
having this strict environment and eval
setup, and you know, whatever lives in
the middle, we almost
in the limit kind of don't care about.
We can initialize it to Alpha Lab 1.0,
but this it should really be this
self-improving system.
Um
and just to leave kind of the the bigger
picture headline result, and my feeling
is you know, this ability to do general
auto research, I think will kind of
become a commodity. Like I think we're
already seeing it with GLM 5.2, and so I
really think
all of your value as like an enterprise
or human expert comes from building
environments. And so like, you know,
temporarily for us that we're still
doing like manual tuning against the
environment, but I think in the limit
the the auto research can research
itself and just be the self-improving
um process.
And so, um
my site's on there and then also the the
project page again the 1.0 version we
released everything and our plan is to
keep just releasing because again, we
think the environments encode all of the
the value. Uh so, thank you.
